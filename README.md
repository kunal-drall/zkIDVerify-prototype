# zkIDVerify

> 🚧 **Project Status: Ideation Phase** - This project is currently in early conceptual development

A privacy-preserving on-chain KYC/KYB protocol powered by vlayer, enabling zero-knowledge identity verification across EVM-compatible blockchains.

## 🎯 Vision

zkIDVerify aims to solve the compliance vs. privacy dilemma in Web3 by enabling users to prove identity attributes (like "age > 18" or "verified business entity") without revealing sensitive personal data. Built on vlayer's verifiable infrastructure, it creates composable primitives for compliant DeFi, DAOs, and dApps.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Current blockchain identity solutions face critical challenges:

- **Privacy Risks**: Centralized KYC providers store sensitive data vulnerable to breaches
- **Centralization**: Oracles and custodians create single points of failure
- **Compliance Barriers**: Regulatory requirements exclude retail users from DeFi/DAOs
- **Cross-Chain Fragmentation**: Identity solutions are chain-specific
- **Sybil Attacks**: Unverified users enable fraud and governance manipulation

## 💡 Solution Overview

zkIDVerify enables users to generate **zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs)** from trusted off-chain sources and submit them on-chain as verifiable attributes.

### Key Features

- **🔒 Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Attest to attributes without revealing underlying data
- **🌐 Cross-EVM Compatibility**: Deploy on Ethereum, Polygon, Base, Arbitrum, and more
- **⚡ vlayer Integration**: Leverages Web Proofs, Teleport, and Time Travel
- **🧩 Composable Primitives**: Proofs stored as ERC-721 soulbound tokens or registry entries
- **📈 Scalable**: Layer-2 solutions for cost-efficient verification

### User Flow

1. **Authenticate** with trusted API (e.g., government ID database)
2. **Generate ZKP** via vlayer's Web Proofs (zkTLS)
3. **Submit proof** to on-chain verifier contract
4. **Query verification** from dApps using SDK

### Smart Contract Example

```solidity
contract zkIDVerifier {
    mapping(address => mapping(bytes32 => bool)) public attestations;
    mapping(address => mapping(bytes32 => uint256)) public expiration;

    function verifyProof(
        bytes calldata proof, 
        bytes32 attribute, 
        uint256 expiry
    ) external {
        require(verifyZK(proof), "Invalid proof");
        attestations[msg.sender][attribute] = true;
        expiration[msg.sender][attribute] = expiry;
    }

    function isValid(address user, bytes32 attribute) external view returns (bool) {
        return attestations[user][attribute] && 
               block.timestamp <= expiration[user][attribute];
    }
}
```

## 🎯 Use Cases

### DeFi Compliance
- Enable undercollateralized loans for verified users
- Age-restricted financial products
- Regulatory-compliant yield farming

### DAO Governance
- Restrict voting to verified members
- Geographic or demographic-based governance
- Sybil-resistant voting mechanisms

### NFTs & Gaming
- Age-restrict access to adult-themed content
- Historical ownership proofs via Time Travel
- Verified player identities for competitive gaming

### Enterprise KYB
- B2B DeFi verification via business registries
- Supply chain compliance
- Insurance automation based on verified records

| **API Access** | Start with open APIs (Estonia's e-Residency), partner with vlayer |
| **Regulatory Variability** | Modular proofs for region-specific compliance |
| **User Adoption** | Wallet-integrated frontend, incentive mechanisms |
| **Scalability** | vlayer credits + Layer-2 deployment |

## 🌟 Ecosystem Impact

zkIDVerify drives vlayer adoption by:
- Generating high volumes of mainnet proofs (1,000+ estimated in 6 months)
- Leveraging Web Proofs and Teleport extensively
- Creating composable primitives for DeFi, DAOs, and beyond
- Open-sourcing circuits and SDKs to inspire other builders

## 🤝 Contributing

This project is in ideation phase and welcomes collaborators! Areas where we need help:

- **Smart Contract Development** (Solidity, zk-SNARKs)
- **Frontend Development** (React, Web3 integration)
- **vlayer Integration** (Web Proofs, Teleport, Time Travel)
- **Legal/Compliance** (KYC/KYB regulations)
- **UX/UI Design** (Privacy-focused user flows)

### Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository (coming soon)
git clone https://github.com/kunal-drall/zkidverify-prototype

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up development environment
npm run setup

# Run tests
npm test
```

## 💰 Funding & Support

Seeking vlayer Grant funding:
- **$10,000 USD** for development, testing, and outreach
- **$10,000** in vlayer compute credits for proof generation

Open to collaboration with vlayer community builders and ecosystem partners.

## 📋 Security Considerations

- **ZK Guarantees**: zk-SNARKs ensure soundness and zero-knowledge properties
- **Sybil Resistance**: Proofs bound to wallet addresses or soulbound tokens
- **Auditability**: Open-source circuits and contracts for community review
- **Revocation**: Built-in expiration and revocation mechanisms
